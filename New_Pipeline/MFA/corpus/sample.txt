Stuttering is when my words get stuck, like I just did. Stuttering is not something that you can help, something that comes along with some people. I get worried like what other people might think if I do stutter. Kids should ignore the people who teases them about stuttering because it's not their fault. I worry about it when I'm on S words and they always get me stuck on stuff, on words with an S in the beginning. help us help those who stutter. Donate now to the Stuttering Foundation of America.
